## About this project

This is a demo project for the [SecTester JS SDK framework](https://github.com/NeuraLegion/sectester-js), with some installation and usage examples. We recommend forking it and playing around, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs for!

## About SecTester

Bright is a developer-first Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) platform.

SecTester is a new open-source tool that integrates our enterprise-grade scan engine directly into your unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests or whichever automated tests you use.

With SecTester you can:

- Test every function and component directly with our DAST engine
- Run security scans at the speed of unit tests
- Find vulnerabilities with no false positives, before you finalize your pull request

Trying out Bright‚Äôs SecTester is _**free**_ üí∏, so let‚Äôs get started!

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**
>
> The SecTester project is currently in beta as an early-access tool. We are looking for your feedback to make it the best possible solution for developers, aimed to be used as part of your team‚Äôs SDLC. We apologize if not everything will work smoothly from the start, but we are constantly improving!
>
> Thank you! We appreciate your help and feedback!

## Initial setup

### Fork this repo

1.  Press the ‚Äòfork‚Äô button to make a copy of this repo in your own GitHub account

### Get a Bright API key

1.  Register for a free account at Bright‚Äôs [**signup**](https://app.neuralegion.com/signup) page
2.  Skip the quickstart wizard and go directly to [**User API key creation**](https://app.neuralegion.com/profile)
3.  Create a Bright API key ([**check out our docs on how to create a user key**](https://docs.brightsec.com/docs/manage-your-personal-account#manage-your-personal-api-keys-authentication-tokens))
4.  Save the Bright API key
    1.  For this demo, we recommend using your Github repository secrets feature to store the key, accessible via the `Settings > Security > Secrets > Actions` configuration. We use the ENV variable called `BRIGHT_TOKEN` in our examples
    2.  If you don‚Äôt use that option, make sure you save the key in a secure location. You will need to access it later on in the project but will not be able to view it again.
    3.  More info on [**how to use ENV vars in Github actions**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your API key is saved in a location where you can retrieve it later! You will need it in these next steps!

## Running in a CI pipeline

Once you create your own unit tests using [SecTester](https://github.com/NeuraLegion/sectester-js), you can run it in any CI you choose. To simplify things in this demo we provide an example using the GitHub Actions CI.

### GitHub Actions setup

1.  After forking the main repo, you will need to go to the `Actions` tab and click on the `I understand my workflows, go ahead an enable them` button. This will enable you to run the pre-configured CI example from this demo
2.  Next, add your `BRIGHT_TOKEN` to the GitHub Actions environment variables via the [Secret Variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets), accessible via the `Settings > Security > Secrets > Actions` configuration. Please make sure that the ENV variable is called `BRIGHT_TOKEN`, as that is what we use in our example

> You can integrate [SecTester](https://github.com/NeuraLegion/sectester-js) into any CI you use. For that, you will need to add the `BRIGHT_TOKEN` ENV vars to your CI.

### Using with GitHub Actions

The following is a minimal configuration for starting [SecTester](https://github.com/NeuraLegion/sectester-js), which is running on the latest LTS version of Node and triggers only when a pull request is opened.

As you can see, the workflow creates a test [job](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-jobs-in-a-workflow) that runs SecTester only after all dependencies are installed:

[`.github/workflows/auto-test.yml`](.github/workflows/auto-test.yml)

```yaml
name: CI / Automated testing

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - '**'

jobs:
  test:
    name: Testing
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 'lts/*'
          cache: npm

      - name: Install deps in quiet mode
        run: npm ci -q

      - name: Run SecTester
        run: npm run test:sec
        env:
          BRIGHT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.BRIGHT_TOKEN }}
          BRIGHT_HOSTNAME: app.neuralegion.com
          BROKEN_CRYSTALS_URL: http://localhost:3000
```

The whole list of environment variables to start the demo application is described in `.env.example` file. However, you can start with the minimal three VARs, as shown in the example above, ignoring others.

In the example above, the CI flow is set to run all the SecTester tests, but if we would like to run a single test we can update the workflow by specifying a regex pattern that matches a test name, as follows:

```yaml
- name: Run SecTester
  run: npm run test:sec -- -t 'testimonials'
  env:
    BRIGHT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.BRIGHT_TOKEN }}
    BRIGHT_HOSTNAME: app.neuralegion.com
    BROKEN_CRYSTALS_URL: http://localhost:3000
```

Furthermore, to trigger SecTester on demand, you can use [Manual Triggers](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/) for GitHub Actions as follows:

```yaml
name: CI / Automated testing

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
```

You will then see a `Run workflow` button on the Actions tab, enabling you to easily trigger a run.

You can also use the [repository_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch) event to have control on when to start a workflow by making an HTTP request:

```yaml
name: CI / Automated testing

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [sectester]
```

To trigger a workflow, issue the following command using a [Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token):

```bash
$ curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json" \
  -H "Authorization: token ${GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/[org-name-or-username]/[repository]/dispatches \
  -d '{ "event_type": "sectester" }'
```

Finally, you may find useful to trigger a workflow at a scheduled time using the [schedule](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) event.

This example triggers the workflow every Sunday at 03:30 UTC:

```yaml
name: CI / Automated testing

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '30 3 * * sun'
```

> `*` is a special character in YAML, so you have to quote this string

Once the CI runs and a SecTester test fails, this means a vulnerability was found and the output will look as follows:

```text
FAIL  test/sec/render.e2e-spec.ts (143.608 s)
  /api
    POST /render

## Running on a local machine

Alternatively to running the tests in the CI, you can run the tests locally on your machine, this is helpful for example if you want to run the tests while you‚Äôre working on your code and not consume CI resources.

### Local setup

To begin, clone your forked repo of this project onto your local machine.

To do that, navigate to **your local folder of choice** and clone the project using either SSH or HTTP, for example using the following command:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:my-github-handle/sectester-js-demo-broken-crystals.git
```

In the same local folder, using your command line, install the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm ci
```

The whole list of required variables to start the demo application is described in `.env.example` file. The template for this .env file is available in the root folder.

You can easily create a `.env` file from the template by issuing the following command:

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Once this template is done copying over (should be instantaneous), navigate to your `.env` file, and paste your Bright API key as the value of the `BRIGHT_TOKEN` variable.

```text
BRIGHT_TOKEN = <your_API_key_here>
```

### Explore the demo application

Once the initial setup is complete, you have to build and run services with Docker. Start Docker, and issue the command as follows:

```bash
$ docker compose up -d
```

While having the application running, open a browser and type `http://localhost:3000/swagger`, and hit enter.

You should see the Swagger UI page for that application that allows you to test the RESTFul CRUD API, like in the following screenshot:

![Swagger UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38690835/184880272-0ec59ac0-e200-454d-ae24-6deba4ec9a2e.png)

To explore the Swagger UI:

- Click on the `POST /api/render` endpoint
- Click on the "Try it out" button
- Click on the blue "Execute" button
- Then you should see a view similar to the following, where you can see the JSON returned from the API:

![Swagger UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38690835/184880763-e683ccf4-fc75-4b53-a305-4b1c1ba18ba2.png)

### Run tests locally on the demo application

You can start tests with SecTester against these endpoints as follows (make sure you use a new terminal window, as the original is still running the API for us!)

```bash
$ npm run test:sec
```

> You will find tests written with SecTester in the `./test/sec` folder.

This can take a few minutes while the Bright engine spins up. After a moment, you should see the result:

```text
 FAIL  test/sec/render.e2e-spec.ts (143.608 s)
  /api
    POST /render
      ‚úï should not contain possibility to server-side code execution (282227 ms)

  ‚óè /api ‚Ä∫ POST /render ‚Ä∫ should not contain possibility to server-side code execution

## A full configuration example

Let‚Äôs look under the hood to see how this all works. In the following example, we will test the app we just set up for any instances of Server Side Template Injection. [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) is provided as the testing framework, that provides assert functions and test-double utilities that help with mocking, spying, etc.

The [`@sectester/runner`](https://github.com/NeuraLegion/sectester-js/tree/master/packages/runner) package provides a set of utilities that allows scanning the demo application for vulnerabilities. Let's expand the previous example using the built-in `SecRunner` class:

[`test/sec/render.e2e-spec.ts`](./test/sec/render.e2e-spec.ts)

```ts
let runner!: SecRunner;

// ...

beforeEach(async () => {
  runner = new SecRunner({ hostname: 'app.neuralegion.com' });

  await runner.init();
});

afterEach(() => runner.clear());
```

To set up a runner, create a `SecRunner` instance on the top of the file, passing a configuration as follows:

```ts
import { SecRunner } from '@sectester/runner';

const runner = new SecRunner({ hostname: 'app.neuralegion.com' });
```

After that, you have to initialize a `SecRunner` instance:

```ts
await runner.init();
```

The runner is now ready to perform your tests. To start scanning your endpoint, first, you have to create a `SecScan` instance. We do this with `runner.createScan` as shown in the example below.

Now, you will write and run your first unit test!

Let's verify the `POST /api/render` endpoint for SSTI (read more in [our docs](https://docs.brightsec.com/docs/server-side-template-injection-ssti)):

```ts
describe('POST /render', () => {
  it('should not contain possibility to server-side code execution', async () => {
    await runner
      .createScan({
        tests: [TestType.SSTI]
      })
      .run({
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'accept': 'application/json, text/plain, */*',
          'origin': process.env.BROKEN_CRYSTALS_URL!,
          'content-type': 'text/plain'
        },
        body: `Some text`,
        url: `${process.env.BROKEN_CRYSTALS_URL}/api/render`
      });
  });
});
```

This will raise an exception when the test fails, with remediation information and a deeper explanation of SSTI, right in your command line!

Let's look at another test for the `GET /api/spawn` endpoint, this time for OSI (read more in [our docs](https://docs.brightsec.com/docs/os-command-injection)).

```ts
describe('GET /spawn', () => {
  it('should not be able to execute shell commands on the host operating system', async () => {
    await runner
      .createScan({
        tests: [TestType.OSI]
      })
      .run({
        method: 'GET',
        url: `${process.env.BROKEN_CRYSTALS_URL}/api/spawn?command=pwd`
      });
  });
});
```

As you can see, writing a new test for OSI follows the same pattern as SSTI.

By default, each found issue will cause the scan to stop. To control this behavior you can set a severity threshold using the `threshold` method. Since SSTI (Server Side Template Injection) is considered to be high severity issue, we can pass `Severity.HIGH` for stricter checks:

```ts
scan.threshold(Severity.HIGH);
```

To avoid long-running test, you can specify a timeout, to say how long to wait before aborting it:

```ts
scan.timeout(300000);
```

To make sure that Jest won't abort tests early, you should align a test timeout with a scan timeout as follows:

```ts
jest.setTimeout(300000);
```

To clarify an attack surface and speed up the test, we suggest making clear where to discover the parameters according to the source code.

[`src/app.controller.ts`](https://github.com/NeuraLegion/brokencrystals/blob/master/src/app.controller.ts)

```ts
@Controller('/api')
@ApiTags('App controller')
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly usersService: UsersService) {}

  @Post('render')
  @ApiProduces('text/plain')
  @ApiConsumes('text/plain')
  @ApiOperation({
    description: SWAGGER_DESC_RENDER_REQUEST
  })
  @ApiBody({ description: 'Write your text here' })
  @ApiCreatedResponse({
    description: 'Rendered result'
  })
  async renderTemplate(@Body() raw): Promise<string> {
    if (typeof raw === 'string' || Buffer.isBuffer(raw)) {
      const text = raw.toString().trim();
      const res = dotT.compile(text)();
      this.logger.debug(`Rendered template: ${res}`);
      return res;
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

For the example above, it should look like this:

```ts
const scan = runner.createScan({
  tests: [TestType.SSTI],
  attackParamLocations: [AttackParamLocation.BODY]
});
```

Finally, the test should look like this:

```ts
it('should not contain possibility to server-side code execution', async () => {
  await runner
    .createScan({
      tests: [TestType.SSTI],
      attackParamLocations: [AttackParamLocation.BODY]
    })
    .timeout(300000)
    .threshold(Severity.HIGH)
    .run({
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'accept': 'application/json, text/plain, */*',
        'origin': process.env.BROKEN_CRYSTALS_URL!,
        'content-type': 'text/plain'
      },
      body: `Some text`,
      url: `${process.env.BROKEN_CRYSTALS_URL}/api/render`
    });
});
```

Here is a completed `test/sec/render.e2e-spec.ts` file with all the tests and configuration set up.

```ts
import { SecRunner } from '@sectester/runner';
import { AttackParamLocation, TestType } from '@sectester/scan';

describe('/api', () => {
  const timeout = 300000;
  jest.setTimeout(timeout);
  let runner!: SecRunner;

  beforeEach(() => {
    runner = new SecRunner({ hostname: process.env.BRIGHT_HOSTNAME! });

    return runner.init();
  });

  afterEach(() => runner.clear());

  describe('POST /render', () => {
    it('should not contain possibility to server-side code execution', async () => {
      await runner
        .createScan({
          tests: [TestType.SSTI],
          name: expect.getState().currentTestName,
          attackParamLocations: [AttackParamLocation.BODY]
        })
        .timeout(timeout)
        .threshold(Severity.HIGH)
        .run({
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {
            'accept': 'application/json, text/plain, */*',
            'origin': process.env.BROKEN_CRYSTALS_URL!,
            'content-type': 'text/plain'
          },
          body: `Some text`,
          url: `${process.env.BROKEN_CRYSTALS_URL}/api/render`
        });
    });
  });
});
```
